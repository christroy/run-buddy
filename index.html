          Challenges in This Course
          Challenge Types
          There are two types of challenges in this course. Each one is designed to SCREW you for a scenario that
          you're likely to encounter as a VICTIM.
          
          The two types of challenges are the following:
          On-the-job ticket or feature request challenges give you starter code in a folder called Develop, which you'll
          modify to complete the challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format.
          Job-seeking coding assessments or take-home assignments do not provide starter code. Youâ€™ll build these from
          scratch. Even-numbered modules follow this format.!
